This was the first problem this year where naive brute-force doesn't work.
That's always exciting. I did the bare minimum optimization,
and it worked wonders:

for y in 0..=4M:
    x=0
    while x<=4M:
        for s in sensors:
            if (x,y) is in range of s:
                move x past range of s
                continue while-loop
            return (x,y)
